# Note-Saver

## Description

- My motivation for this project is to create a note taker app for a user to save and access notes organized in one single webpage
- I built this project because it will help the user organize their notes in a neat way, and have them accessible and up for revison
- This application saves time for the user and helps the user and myself to be collected and jot down future assignments for school/work or any tasks and sets it all on one webpage to be viewed 
- I learned how to connect the back end to the front end by using get and post requests to save and retrieve user data

## Installation

To install and run this application, you just click the link that was deployed from heroku and press "Get Started". From here the user is able to view existing notes on the left hand side, access them by clicking the title, and is able to add a new note with a title and description that can be saved and viewed alongside the other notes.

## Usage

This is the link to the functional application deployed on heroku.
